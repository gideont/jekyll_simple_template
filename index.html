title: Simple Website generated by Jekyll

<h4>Welcome to {{ page.title }}</h4>

<br>
<p>
    This page is a very simple static website generated using Jekyll static site generator.  One of the main advantages of using Jekyll is that it can generate consistent navigation bar without using server side scripts.
</p>

<p>
    The generated static pages can then be hosted in github, GCP Storage or AWS S3 in a very low budget serverless infrastructure.  The pages can also be deployed to content delivery network (CDN) to distribute globally easily.

    Once jekyll is installed, this template source code can be easily built and run in live server using the following command:
</p>

<p class="code_snippet">
    $ jekyll serve --livereload
</p>

Follow the output default server address http://127.0.0.1:4000 to see the website goes live.
