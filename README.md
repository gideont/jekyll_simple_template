# Welcome to Simple Website Template for Jekyll

## Why I need this

I wrote this as a template to generate static pages website quickly.  One of my headache is the menu/natvigation bar, which I do not want to copy and paste and update across all my pages to keep them consistent.  Jekyll is the tool which solves my problem.  This source code is a very simple jekyll website template with a navigation bar and bootstrap4 UI framework. 

One of the main advantages of using Jekyll is that it can generate consistent navigation bar without using server side scripts.

The generated static pages can then be hosted in github, GCP Storage or AWS S3 in a very low budget serverless infrastructure. The pages can also be deployed to content delivery network (CDN) to distribute globally easily.

Once jekyll is installed, this template source code can be easily built and run in live server using the following command:

```bash
$ jekyll serve --livereload
```

Follow the output default server address http://127.0.0.1:4000 to see the website goes live.
